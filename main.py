    @Description : 
        - Having an old yet lovely Computer ?
        - Trying to develop a simple or complex(oh boy good luck...) program with java ?
        - Your computer can't handle InteliJ IDEA, VS Code , eclipse etc....

        Don't be stupid and use linux distriputions where you can do a banch more usefull 
        stuff and literally free your computer from the chains of microsoft. Those are for
        people who respect themselves ,wich we and you are cleary dont. Simply use our great
        with no bugs at all open source code to do the job. <3 !

        -Now that we laughed(not) with my houmor. This is an open-source code 
        that simply does the dirty work for you when writing code with java, something 
        like what InteliJ idea does when you hit the run button, but those guys really
        know what they're doing unlike us.

        We did it mostly for practice and test our knowlegde. Hope you like it.
        More than happy to accept your thoughts!.
